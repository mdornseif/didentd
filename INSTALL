This is experimental stuff. Basically it works like dffingerd.

FOR THE IMPATIENT:

You need tcpserver and daemontools.

# make install
create two users: identd and identdl
# mkdir /var/service
# /usr/local/bin/dident-conf identd identdl /var/service/identd 0.0.0.0
# ln -s /var/service/identd /service/


INSTALLING 

Untar, compile and install didentd as root:

  	# make install

This will create didentd, didentd-name, didentd-decrypt, didentd-conf,
didentd-name-conf and leapsecs in /usr/local/bin and leapsecs.dat in
/etc/

Now create two users one for running didentd and one for logging. I
will use "identd" and "identdl".

Decide where to put didentd data. This example will use
"/var/service/identd". Then run didentd-conf:

	# didentd-conf identd identdl /var/service/identd 0.0.0.0

You can replace 0.0.0.0 by the IP adress didentd should bind to.
0.0.0.0 will bind it to all your IP adresses.

Now you can start didentd by telling svscan about it:

	# ln -s /var/service/identd /service/

svscan should start didentd within the next five seconds and didend
will start handing out audit tokens to ident requests. The audit
tokens contain a userid, source and destination ip and port and a
tai64 timestamp in encrypted form. 

This audit token can be decrypted again by piping it through
didentd-decrypt.

If you do not want to hand out encrypted audit tokens but usernames
instead you might use didentd-name and didentd-name-conf which act
exactly like their counterpart but send usernames. Don't do that,
respect the privacy of your users. If you would like to send a static
reply use didentd-static and didentd-static-conf.
