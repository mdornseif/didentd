didentd is a RfC1423 (identd) server for Linux written with security
in mind. It is designed to run with Dan Bernsteins daemontools and
uscpi-tcp. You can get this tools at http://cr.yp.to/.

The Server runs chrooted under /proc/net on an unprivileged id. 

There is didentd-name which returns the username of the uid owning the
requested connection. This is the classican ident approach.

There is didentd which does not send an username but an encrypted
audit token to the client. This token contains all information about
the requested connection: 
* userid owning the connection 
* source ip:port 
* destination ip:port 
* a timestamp

If a remote admin has a complain about something from your machine he
can send this audit token back to you, you can pipe it through
didentd-decrypt and find out which user did the connection.
didentd-decrypt outputs all information from the audit token.
