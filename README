didentd is a ident server with paranoia in mind. See 
http://c0re.jp/c0de/didentd for further information.

Have a look at WHY-TAP for a discussion why you should run an ident
server TAP/auth/ident are names for variants of the same protocol.
See WHY-ENCRYPT for a discussion of why you should use encrypted ident
replys. The second part of WHY-ENCRYPT discusses the implementation of
encrypted identd replys in pidentd which uses a different
strategy than I do.

See INSTALL for help on installing his.
